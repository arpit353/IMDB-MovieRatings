# IMDb Movie Information
**Updated version is available here - <a href="https://github.com/bodhwani/awesome-movies-prediction">awesome-movie-prediction</a>**
<br>
A python script that looks up all movies in a folder on IMDb and gets the ratings, genre and plot of the movie and stores it in an excel sheet.
I wrote this to be able to decide which movie I wanted to watch from all the movies I had on my disk.

After running this script, excel file will be generated in the same folder in which this script is present.<br>

- urllib - pip install urllib2<br>
- json - pip install simplejson<br>

### Conditions<br>
Your movies in the folder must contain names that can be found in IMDB. For eg. It cannot be like The Double(2013)[YTS], The Double1080.pxBR etc.The Double(2013) will work completely fine.
